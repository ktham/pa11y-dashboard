Setup
-----

pa11y-dashboard requires [Node.js][node] 0.10+ and [pa11y-webservice][pa11y-webservice] to be installed and running. You'll need to follow the setup guide for pa11y-webservice before setting up pa11y-dashboard.

You'll then need to clone this repo locally and install dependencies with `npm install`.

Once you have a local clone, you'll need to copy some sample configuration files in order to run the application. From within the repo, run the following commands:

```sh
$ cp config/development.sample.json config/development.json
$ cp config/production.sample.json config/production.json
```

Each of these files defines configurations for a different environment. If you're just running the application locally, then you should be OK with just development configurations. The [available configurations are documented here](#configurations).

Now that you've got your application configured, you can run in each mode with the following commands:

```sh
$ NODE_ENV=production node .   # Run in production
$ NODE_ENV=development node .  # Run in development
```

Check the [development instructions](#development) for more information about running locally (and restarting automatically when files change).


Configurations
--------------

The boot configurations for pa11y-dashboard are as follows. Look at the sample JSON files in the repo for example usage.

### webservice
*(string)* The base URL of the [pa11y-webservice][pa11y-webservice] instance you intend on using.

### port

### noindex
*(boolean)* If set to `true` (default), the dashboard will not be indexed by search engines. Set to `false` to allow indexing.

### readonly

### siteMessage
*(string)* A message to display prominently on the site home page. Defaults to `null`.


Development
-----------

To develop pa11y-dashboard, you'll need to clone the repo and get set up as outlined in the [setup guide](#setup). You'll also need [Grunt][grunt] to be installed globally in order to run tests, you can do this with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Now you'll be able to run the following commands:

```sh
$ grunt          # Run the lint and test tasks together
$ grunt lint     # Run JSHint with the correct config
$ grunt compile  # Compile front-end assets
$ grunt start    # Run app in development mode, restarting if files change
$ grunt watch    # Watch for file changes and compile assets
```

Code with lint errors or failing tests will not be accepted, please use the build tools outlined above.

For users with push-access, don't commit to the master branch. Code should be in `develop` until it's ready to be released.
